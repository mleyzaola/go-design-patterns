# go-design-patterns

This is a summary of some design patterns in Go, along with markdown files which contains examples on how to use each pattern.

Source was taken from this repository: https://github.com/tmrts/go-patterns, only took the relevant to this tech talk, but feel free to read others as you will probably gain more knowledge.

  02-implement-functional-options
  03-car-to-string-function
  04-extending-options-max-speed
